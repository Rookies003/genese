    <h2>HTML</h2>

     <p>(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p><p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p><p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such </p><p>as <strong>&lt;head,&gt; <strong>&lt;title,&gt;<strong>&lt;body,&gt;<strong>&lt;header,&gt;<strong>&lt;footer,&gt;,<strong>&lt;head,&gt;,and many others.</p><p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the  tag can be written as <strong>&lt;Title,&gt;, <strong>&lt;TITLE,&gt;, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.</p>
